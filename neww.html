    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Great web developer with deep interest in computing, passionate about
      every new discovery. From communicating with an artificial intelligence to
      seeing the wonders of the Internet for the first time, computers have left
      me fascinated with just how much power yet mystery they hold. My interest
      in computing has not been restricted to the classroom. Within the last
      twelve months I have used the knowledge that I’ve gained, with the help of
      my family, to set up my own computer-related business. This has given me a
      totally new perspective on how certain things function, and how business
      operates. I am also experienced at providing great customer service,
      dedicated to assisting customers resolve issues. Furthermore, I am an
      expert on- Web Development App Development Cloth Branding Creating
      Presentation Content Creating Writing Completing tasks effectively and
      efficiently Excellent communication, both written and verbal Ability to
      multitask I am always interested in forming long-term professional
      relationships with clients to ensure that every project becomes
